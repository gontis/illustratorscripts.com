Script pallette window to launch scripts in Adobe Illustrator


Placing a script in the Illustrator script folder, relaunching the application, and finding the script through File > Scripts can be a tedious task. Enter ScriptLauncher, a tool that provides a simple interface for quickly launching other scripts within Illustrator. This script is a must-have for any professional who runs Adobe Illustrator scripts on a daily basis.

//Key Features:

* Quickly add shortcuts to any script. \cr
* Filter the script list by entering the name pattern in the search box. \cr
* Label scripts with color. \cr



//Additional Features:

* Ability to operate with single click, aka button mode.
* Refresh the script list to reflect file changes.
* Add or remove multiple folders easily by editing the folders.txt file.
* Open the script file for editing and the script folder easily.



//Notes:

ScriptLauncher will create a ScriptLauncher.json file in the <User>/Documents/ folder to save shortcuts and settings.

ScriptLauncher will read the folders.txt file from the parent folder. In the folders.txt file, users can place folder URLs from where scripts will be read and added to the ScriptLauncher script list. For example, if user keeps some scripts on network drive or on Desktop, he can add 

~/Desktop/NEW_SCRIPTS 
\\192.168.1.11\scripts

and ScriptLauncher will load scripts from desktop and from remote machine.

Writting .. will tell ScriptLauncher to access scripts in parent folder.
